The thrill of watching chemical reactions unfold right before your eyes is breathtaking.

Rowling, J.R.R. Tolkein, and George R.R. Matring, chemistry seemed like the closest thing to fantasy.

Being able to share the experience of a drink with others that was start to finish your own is memorable and something that is to be cherished.
