### ABOUT THE PROJECT
I decided to make my react project a sort of online resume. With three different pages (home, hobbies, and projects), I hope that employers will have a good understanding of who I am and what I am capable of after looking at this website.<br><br>
My reusable react components are the website title, the banner text, the navigation bar, and the footer. The footer also reads from a JSON data file.
