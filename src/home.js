            My name is Mike Digan. I am a senior studying computer science at Colorado Mesa University.
            I began my collegiate journey back in 2013 when I sought out a Bachelor's degree in accounting
            with a minor in computer science. Upon completion of that program, I had a brief aside where
            I studied higher level calculus with the intent of developing my analytical ability. Once I had
            finished my calculus courses I decided to take the few remaining courses that stood between me
            and my Bachelor's in computer science. I re-enrolled to Colorado Mesa University in the spring
            of 2020 and will finish my CS degree in May of 2021.
